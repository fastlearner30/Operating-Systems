One function of an operating system is security. They often use password protection and other methods. This prevents unauthorized access to the data and programs. For most systems, you must enter a password or pin to access any part of the system.
A second function of an operating system is shutting down the computer or device. Sometimes people don't actually shut them off and leave them running in the background all the time. You have the option of actually shutting it down, allowing it to go into sleep mode, or hibernating mode. Sometimes you can shut off the system by simply closing the top of a laptop, or pressing a quick button.
A third function is managing programs. One program is usually on the front of the screen while the others run behind it in the background. Some of the newer systems allow you to multi task so you can have multiple programs open and available at the same time as well as view them. An example is running a browser looking at something on the web while still having your email open and able to view.
